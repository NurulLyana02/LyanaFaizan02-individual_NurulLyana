<h1> MY UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE </h1>

My university experience so far has been amazing. I have learned and experienced so many new 
things in such a short period of time, and it has passed so quickly. 
I still discover all the opportunities the university has to offer me. 
UiTM is a very friendly place and from day one, I felt right at home here. 
I have made many new friends from various backgrounds. 
I was also able to learn dialects that are always heard such as 
the Kelantan dialect and also other unique dialects such as the Iban dialect.

		<br>
		<br>
		
Now, I am a senior which is my second year and last semester at Universiti Teknologi Mara Cawangan Kedah. 
Until the previous semester, I was not at all interested in university life, 
did not participate in various clubs, never went to festivals, 
did not go to activities with fellow students and did not
communicate with other students from other classes.
But after a few months, Alhamdulillah I was able to adapting the environment at the university.
However, after only one semester at UiTM, Malaysia was shocked by the outbreak of covid-19, which interrupted all of the learning activities.
Students are asked to conduct online teaching and learning sessions to decide on the spread of this epidemic among the community and students.

		<br>
		<br>
		
My online learning experience as a student was not very good. I just love how I don’t have to get up early in the morning every day
 to go to regular classes what I don’t like about it is that for
 me it’s confusing when too much work is given so I can’t divide my study 
 time effectively. Being in a physical classroom makes me just focus on my 
 work, but online learning makes it harder to focus because I also have to
 focus on things at home and it makes me lose interest. 
 I don’t want to do online learning in the future because it’s hard for me to focus on my work.
 
		<br>
		<br>
		
Instead, in school, I complete all my assignments on time without feeling lazy. 
The only thing I love about online classes is that they have helped me learn how to be independent, manage family time and assignments. 
I don’t really like how some of my lecturers give us more assignments now than ever before. 
Also, I don’t understand how to do a lot of class work because I forget or find it hard to understand without anyone’s help.
 Being physically in the classroom, I have more classmates to ask for help. 
 In class, I can enlist the help of the lecturer as much as I need and most likely I will understand the assignment. 
 It is completely different online because I have to be smart in handling the resources provided by UiTM and
 finding information through authentic sources.
 I prefer to have physical communication with the lecturer.
 
		<br>
		<br>
		
These are my friends who always help me in succeeding in all the work given by the 
lecturers. They never gave up in helping me to complete my assignment. 
I would like to give a little appreciation to them for having helped me 
so much without complaining.
