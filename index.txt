		"Donâ€™t let others box you into their idea of what they think you should be. 
		A confined identity is a miserable way to exist.
<br>
		You and live free. Trust that in living true to yourself, you will attract people that support and love you, 
		just as you are."
<br>	- Jaeda deWalt

<br>
		I'm glad to be here. 
<br>
		In this blog, I also combine the passion for aesthetic photography with the love of cooking, 
		fashion and the most beautiful things in life. 
<br>
		Inspired by art, design, cuisine, fashion and photography, it is this interest 
		that gives my work a unique and differentiated view and feeling.
<br>
		Food styling and minimalist fashion are some of the content you can find here. 
		I also have various hobbies, and I believe that there are many
<br>
		individuals in the same situation as me who may benefit from my day-to-day experiences.
<br>
		So, I'm thinking of starting a blog to remember my days
		but I also think it might be enjoyable if I make the most of it.
